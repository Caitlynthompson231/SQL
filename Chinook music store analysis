#In this project we will be doing a Business analysis of albums and tracks sold by different artists and different profit per genre to find which three artists are most recommended to buy to 
sell at the record store in Chinook

#1. In this query we present an assessment on the volume of tracks sold per genre within the database using a structured JOIN operation to gather data from 3 different tables and 
we rely on an aggregated function that effectivey quantifies the number of tracks sold and finish with an order by statement to unveil the highest performing genres first 
#How many tracks are sold in each genre?
SELECT GEN.name AS Genre, COUNT(*) AS TracksSold
FROM chinook.genres GEN
JOIN chinook.tracks TRA ON GEN.GenreId = TRA.GenreId
JOIN chinook.invoice_items ITM ON TRA.TrackId = ITM.TrackId
GROUP BY Genre
ORDER BY TracksSold DESC;

#2. In this query we present an assesment in the volume of tracks sold per genre from the United States and this time by percent instead of absolute numbers
SELECT GEN.name AS Genre,
      ROUND (COUNT(CASE WHEN CUS.Country = 'USA' THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*)) AS PercentageSoldInUSA
FROM chinook.genres GEN
JOIN chinook.tracks TRA ON GEN.GenreId = TRA.GenreId
JOIN chinook.invoice_items ITM ON TRA.TrackId = ITM.TrackId
JOIN chinook.invoices INV ON ITM.InvoiceId = INV.InvoiceId
JOIN chinook.customers CUS ON INV.CustomerId = CUS.CustomerId
GROUP BY Genre
ORDER BY PercentageSoldInUSA DESC

#3. This SQL query is designed to compile a comprehensive and organized dataset that showcases the top-selling artists within the Chinook music store based on track sales.
This query serves as a valuable tool for making informed decisions regarding potential album acquisitions for the Chinook store, offering a consolidated overview of top-performing 
artists and their respective track sales data
SELECT GEN.name AS Genre , ART.Name AS Artist,
TRK.name AS 'Song Title', 
COUNT(*) AS 'Tracks Sold'
FROM chinook.genres AS GEN
LEFT JOIN chinook.tracks AS TRK ON GEN.GenreId = TRK.GenreId
LEFT JOIN chinook.albums AS ALB ON TRK.AlbumId = ALB.AlbumId
LEFT JOIN chinook.artists AS ART ON ALB.ArtistId = ART.ArtistId
GROUP BY Genre 
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC

#4. Closing Analysis
After a meticulous analysis of the Chinook music store's sales data, it is evident that to enhance the store's music collection strategically, the acquisition of albums by AC/DC, 
Caetano Veloso, and Apocalyptica is highly recommended. These three artists represent distinct musical genres, facilitating a dynamic and diversified appeal to a broader audience. Notably, 
these recommendations align with data-driven insights, as AC/DC stands out as the top-selling artist, amassing over 1,000 tracks sold for their iconic song 'For Those About To Rock (We Salute You).'
This selection not only caters to customer preferences but also capitalizes on proven track records, ensuring a more enriching and profitable music catalog.
